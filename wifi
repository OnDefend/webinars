Use NetSpot and InSSIDer on the Laptop to execute the test.

With InSSIDer, run a pacp when doing the overall survey.

When you join the guest network, run it as a snapshot, make sure "Discover LAN Clients" is enabled.

Please take lots and lots of screenshots.  This is really important as lots of the graphics are not replayable via the packet captures or exports the tools will take.

For the survey, plug in the Alpha USB wifi dongle, start NetSPot, InSSIDer, and wireshark, then walk around the outside perimter of the building, then walk through the office floors.


Testing once you are on the network:

1. Perform site survey with NetSpot on OnDefend Laptop
2. Start wireshark, capturing on the wireless interface (wlan0)
3. Attempt to join each wireless network.  If it asks for a Pre-Shared Key, either enter the real one or a guess.  If it asks for username/password auth try that as well (even if you know the guess will be wrong).  Save each network as a separate PCAP file.
4. Once you are connected to a network, try the following items:
Commands to Run:
	- Ipconfig /ALL
	- Arp -a
	- Route print
	- Go-out Testing**
	- Nslookup <internal host name>
	- Ping internal 


** Go-Out is a utility to test outbound connectivity.

Open a Powershell prompt
Change the directory to Documents (cd Documents)
Run the following command: ".\go-out.exe -start=20 -end=8888

Save the output of this command into your notes
